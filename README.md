# picture-puzzle
One of those puzzle where you shift pieces around by moving the an adjacent piece into the empty spot. 
If you'd like to see it in action go to [kvinklly.com](http://kvinklly.com/picture-puzzle/). 
If you would like to put this on your own site, you will need to first add an image with the name 
'image.jpg' in the img/ directory.

Also, note that there are two versions of the main javascript file. The one with es6 in the name is the 
one I actually coded, and the one with the name 'picture-puzzle.js' was transpiled using [babel](http://babeljs.io/). 
That one is compatible with older browsers.
